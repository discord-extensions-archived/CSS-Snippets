## Credits
I got this idea from hellbound's Discord Revamp theme, there are some borders in there that are more rounded. Also, to figure out how to get some things to work, I had to look at a bit of that code. 
#### TLDR: Almost all credit goes to hellbound, for the idea and some of the code that I used to figure some things out.
