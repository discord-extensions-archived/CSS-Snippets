Inspired by hellbound's Modern Indicators, I've remade this but made them a bit better.

## Credit
As stated, this was inspired by hellbound's modern indicators. I decided to remake these and add some rounding to the right end of them. I recoded everything from scratch so it might be more scuffed than his, but it works.
